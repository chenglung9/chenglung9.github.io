**Senior Operations Research Developer, Southwest Airlines**  Sep 2024 - Now

*Aircraft Assignment, Route Planning and Recovery Optimization Under Disruption*

* Enhanced Southwest Airlines’ real-time operations recovery optimization system (Baker) by tailoring solution metrics to six irregular-operation scenarios and four solution profiles, enabling faster and more informed decision-making for operations controllers.
* Improved visibility of crew impacts within recovery solutions by introducing new metrics (duty/rest violations, insufficient connection time, cascading crew availability after cancellations), strengthening reliability and reducing risk of uncovered flights.
* Designed and implemented a fuel-efficiency–aware tail assignment algorithm, assigning long-haul flights to lower fuel-bias aircraft. This innovation reduced delays and passenger displacement, improved on-time maintenance compliance, and lowered fuel consumption and costs while contributing to environmental sustainability goals.
* Relevant skills: Operations Research, C++, Gitlab, Amazon Web Services, Scaled Agile Framework

**Operations Research Consultant, American Airlines**  Jun 2022 - Aug 2024

*Crew Schedule Operations and Recovery Under Disruption*

* Enhance the mathematical optimization engine's computational performance for the crew recovery system used in airline disruption management through meticulous maintenance and deployment of new features, enhancing the [resilience against 2022 winter storm Elliott](https://businesstravelerusa.com/news/american-airlines-coo-thanks-staff-over-remarkable-performance-in-december/) as well as resulting in an impressive 40% improvement in 2023.

**Research Intern, Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories**  Dec 2020 - Apr 2021
* Develope a risk-constrained virtual power plant energy optimization model with novel bidding strategies. 
* Conduct numerical studies to demonstrate the benefit and efficacy of the proposed model.

**Visiting Research Associate, Eglin Air Force Research Laboratory** May 2018 - Aug 2018
* Develop the mathematical model formulation strength and implement stochastic dual dynamic integer programming algorithm for Two-Stage Stochastic Interdependent Networks Mitigation and Restoration.
